🐞 AI-Powered Bug Triage & Auto-Fix Suggestions
📌 Overview

In large software projects, thousands of bugs get reported daily. Sorting, categorizing, and prioritizing these bugs is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI + NLP) to:

Analyze bug reports written in plain English

Classify bugs into categories (UI, Backend, Performance, Security, etc.)

Assign priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Suggest potential fixes or root causes

The goal is to save developer time and make bug management more efficient.

🚀 Features

🤖 AI Classification: Uses NLP models to classify bug type.

⚡ Priority Prediction: AI auto-assigns bug severity based on report details.

💡 Fix Suggestions: Generates a possible cause or next step for developers.

🔗 Integration Ready: Can connect with Jira/GitHub APIs for real-world usage.
